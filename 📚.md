[The Illustrated DeepSeek-R1](https://newsletter.languagemodels.co/p/the-illustrated-deepseek-r1)
- For the interim reasoning mode, the RL steps use rule based verification to improve reasoning task performance without requiring significant amounts of labeled data.  
- The interim model is used to generate quality RL training data where the interim model is trained on a smaller set of data and then a larger set of data is generated based on the model. Then, only the best labeled sets of the generated data is used for training the actual model itself.

[XtremeDistilTransformers: Task Transfer for Task-agnostic Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04563)
- Given a deep teacher and a shallow student, we align all the layers of the student to the topmost layers of the teacher  
- We conjecture this to be an artifact of model capacity as it becomes increasingly difficult for a shallow student to mimic a much bigger and deeper teacher.

[MiniLM: Deep Self-Attention Distillation for Task-Agnostic Compression of Pre-Trained Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10957)
- Specifically, we propose distilling the self-attention module of the last Transformer layer of the teacher, which is effective and flexible for the student. Furthermore, we introduce the scaled dot-product between values in the self-attention module as the new deep self-attention knowledge, in addition to the attention distributions (i.e., the scaled dot-product of queries and keys) that have been used in existing works.  
- Compared with previous approaches, using knowledge of the last Transformer layer rather than performing layer-to-layer knowledge distillation alleviates the difficulties in layer map- ping between the teacher and student models, and the layer number of our student model can be more flexible  
- Using scaled dot-product between self- attention values also converts representations of different dimensions into relation matrices with the same dimensions without introducing additional parameters to transform stu- dent representations, allowing arbitrary hidden dimensions for the student mode

[Automation of Summary Evaluation by the Pyramid Method](https://github.com/ryumingi/ryumingi.github.io/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%96)
- There are O(n^2) \+ possible such sets for sentences of words; to avoid exponential runtime, we use a two-dimensional dynamic pro- graming algorithm, which selects the best contributor set for each span of words between the ith and jth words of a sentence, eventually producing a preferred covering for the entire sentence.  
- The difference in correlation between the automatic Pyramid and the ROUGE scores is statistically significant (p 0.05) for all cases except the Pearson correlation between the automatic Pyramid (0.942) and ROUGE-1 recall score (0.805), which is not statistically significant (p \= 0.129). We expect that more data will allow us to establish statistical significance for the remaining com- parison as well.  
- Note that for ROUGE, as for our automatic evaluation, unigrams performs best, followed by the skip bigrams/unigrams combination, followed by the bi- grams. The differences among the ROUGE scores are considerable.

[Evaluation of Text Generation: A Survey](https://github.com/ryumingi/ryumingi.github.io/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%96)
- The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (bleu) is one of the first metrics used to measure the similarity between two sentences (Papineni et al., 2002). Originally proposed for machine translation, it compares a candidate translation of text to one or more reference translations. bleu is a weighted geometric mean of n-gram precision scores.  
- Caccia et al. (2018) found that generated text with perfect bleu scores was often grammatically correct but lacked semantic or global coherence, concluding that the generated text has poor information content.  
- In Graham (2015), it was concluded that bleu achieves strongest correlation with human assessment, but does not significantly outperform the best-performing rouge vari- ant. A more recent study has demonstrated that n-gram matching scores such as bleu can be an insufficient and potentially less accurate metric for unsupervised language generation (Semeniuta et al., 2019).  
- Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (rouge) (Lin, 2004\) is a set of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization of long texts consisting of multiple sentences or paragraphs.  
- rouge-l measures the longest matching sequence of words using longest common sub-sequence (LCS); rouge-s (less commonly used) measures skip-bigram15 \-based co-occurrence statistics; rouge-su (less commonly used) measures skip-bigram and unigram-based co-occurrence statistics.  
- Type-Token Ratio (ttr) is a measure of lexical diversity (Richards, 1987), mostly used in linguistics to determine the richness of a writer‚Äôs or speaker‚Äôs vocabulary. It is computed as the number of unique words (types) divided by the total number of words (tokens) in a given segment of language.  
- The pyramid metric relies on manual human labeling effort, which makes it difficult to automate. peak: Pyramid Evaluation via Automated Knowledge Extraction (Yang et al., 2016\) was presented as a fully automated variant of pyramid model, which can automatically assign the pyramid weights and was shown to correlate well with human judgments.

[DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf)
- Some graphs are created as a by-product of agents interacting with a sequence of elements (e.g. users‚Äô navigation of pages on a website). When a graph is created by such a stream of non-random walks, we can use this process to feed the modeling phase directly. Graphs sampled in this way will not only capture information related to network structure, but also to the frequency at which paths are traversed.

[Illustrating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)
- There are multiple methods for ranking the text. One method that has been successful is to have users compare generated text from two language models conditioned on the same prompt. By comparing model outputs in head-to-head matchups, an Elo system can be used to generate a ranking of the models and outputs relative to each-other. These different methods of ranking are normalized into a scalar reward signal for training.

[When does Weighted A\* Fail?](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~ruml/papers/wted-astar-socs-12.pdf)
- For example, the Fast Downward planner (Helmert 2006\) uses Weighted A\*, and LAMA (Richter and Westphal 2010\) also uses a variant of Weighted A\*.  
- We first showed that greedy search can sometimes perform worse than A\*, and that although in many domains there is a general trend where a larger weight in Weighted A\* leads to a faster search, there are also domains where a larger weight leads to a slower search. It has long been understood that greedy search has no bounds on performance, but our work shows that poor behavior can occur in practice.

[Deep Blue](https://bi.snu.ac.kr/Courses/4ai10f/Papers/Campbell%202002%20-%20Deep%20blue.pdf)
- The extended book \[6\] in Deep Blue is a mechanism that allows a large Grandmaster game database to influence and direct Deep Blue‚Äôs play in the absence of opening book information. The basic idea is to summarize the information available at each position of a 700,000 game database, and use the summary information to nudge Deep Blue in the consensus direction of chess opening theory.  
- The specific mechanism used in Deep Blue was to assign bonuses (or penalties) to those moves in a given position that had been played in the Grandmaster game database. For example, suppose that in the opening position of a chess game the move d4 is given a 10 point bonus. Deep Blue would carry out its regular search, but offset the alpha-beta search window for d4 by 10 points. Thus d4 would be preferred if it was no more than 10 points worse than the best of the other moves.

[Steps Toward Artificial Intelligence](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/steps.pdf)
- The problem of extinction or "unlearning" is especially critical for complex, hierarchical, learning.

[LLM+P: Empowering Large Language Models with Optimal Planning Proficiency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11477.pdf)
- LLM+P takes in a natural language description of a planning problem, then returns a correct (or optimal) plan for solving that problem in natural language. LLM+P does so by first converting the language description into a file written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then leveraging classical planners to quickly find a solution, and then translating the found solution back into natural language.  
- Without the context (i.e., an example problem and its corresponding problem PDDL), we observe that LLMs fail to produce correct problem PDDL files. The failures of LLM+P (no context) come entirely from incorrect problem encodings. Therefore, the context is important for LLM+P to work.

[Tweets to Citations: Unveiling the Impact of Social Media Influencers on AI Research Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13782)

The complementary contributions of academia and industry to AI research
- Over the last 25 years, industry teams get more attention, are highly cited, and produce more state of the art models. Academic teams produce higher novelty work, unconventional and atypical. Robust control for subfield, team size, seniority, and prestige. Academic-industry collaboration is more similar to industry teams than academic teams.  
- Academic-industry team does not bring the "best of the both worlds"  
- The initial high impact of the academic-industry team might have been due to larger average team size and self-citation.  
- In 2020, industry teams were 74% more likely to be highly cited than academic teams.  
- Industry or academic-industry teams publish on interdisciplinary subfields, which is more likely to be cited by another field.  
- In AI research, citations are correlated with state of the art models rather than novelty.  
- Do the self and cross citations compare between teams or authors? In other words, if an industry team A cites industry team B, is that considered self citation within industry teams?  
- Larger team size has more influence outlets and likelier to include researchers with different backgrounds.  
- academic-industry team is bigger, then why is it doing worse?  
- "We speculate that industry research is becoming increasingly more impactful and citation disruptive because they have more access to data, computational power, and people."  
- "AI field moves too fast"  
- "Influence of these publications is not perceived through direct citations, but rather through network effects."  

Predicting the longevity of resources shared in scientific publications
- Most important factors are where and how the resource is shared. Author's reputation or prestige of the journal does not play a considerable factor.  
- Censored regression model, Random Forest, Wayback Machine API.  
- About 90% of the URLs were alive. The mean life span is 19.45 years.  
- Self-citation negatively correlates with lifespan. Length of the URL negatively correlates with maintainability. Presence of iframe tag negatively correlates with longevity.

The Impact of Heterogeneous Shared Leadership in Scientific Teams
- First authors do not fit the definition of scientific leadership.  
- Combination of senior and junior leaders acn maximize team perforamnce compared to leaders of similar age.  
- Paper citation is not a perfect metric for evaluating team performance.

Effects of Same-Race Mentorship Preferences on Academic Performance and Survival
- Increase in same-race mentorship prospensity over the years (last 70 years). It's more pronounced for minorities. High same-race prospensity strongly correlates with lower productivity, impact, and collaboration reach, ultimately leading to 27.6% reduced linklihood of remaining in academia.  
- Academic Family Tree project and the MAG.

Predicting scientific success
- academic-tree.org. Scopus. Linear regression with elastic net regularization.

Are AI Ethics Conferences Different and More Diverse Compared to Traditional Computer Science Conferences?
- MAG and Semantic Scholar. BERT-based gender and race prediction model.  
- TFIDF + multinomial logistic regression to find predictive tokens.  
- Asian countries lack publications of AIE conferences compared to NA and EU.  
- AIE has more field diversity but less country diversity. AIE has lower male authorship but higher white authorship. h-index is insignificant.

International Workshop on Data-driven Science of Science
- "In a practical sense, science of science research can promote young scientists to establish their early career life, better evaluate the performance of scientific projects, track popular research frontiers, and even discover new questions from data."  

Is the future of peer review automated?
- "Automated screening tools cannot replace peer review, but may aid authors, reviewers, and editors in improving scientific papers."  
- ScreenIT pipeline has been used on bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints.  
- Automated tools have the most potential to aid in assessing compliance.  
- "Future work should enhance existing tools, simplify integration of tools into editorial systems, and train reviewers, editors and authors to use tool reports to improve papers. If successful, automated tools could reduce poor reporting and educate researchers about reporting best practices."

Don't judge a journal by its cover?: Appearance of a Journal's website as predictor of blacklisted Open-Access status

[Damegender: Towards an International and Free Dataset about Name, Gender and Frequency](https://easychair.org/publications/preprint\\_open/zTxh)
* The dataset is covering more than 20 countries in the occidental world reaching a big number of names and accuracies around (0.9%)  
* Nowadays, many people are using APIs such as Genderapi, Genderize, Namsor, or NameApi. Other people are using solutions based on Wikipedia, or Free Software solutions (NLTK\[LB02\], R Gender, Gender Detector, Gender Computer3, ...)  
* BHKZ11, MLA+11 \- Twitter  
* WGJS15 \- Wikipedia  
* In \[MS16\] presents how to infer gender in Twitter. They are using namdict and the US census as datasets. The features are ‚Äônumber of consonants‚Äô, ‚Äônumber of vowels‚Äô, ‚Äônumber of syllables‚Äô, ‚Äônumber of bouba consonants‚Äô, ‚Äônumber of bouba vowels‚Äô, ‚Äônumber of kiki consonants‚Äô, ‚Äônumber of kiki vowels‚Äô. The classification model is using SVM.  
* \[AWM+09\] was presented as a system to classify name and ethnicity from Open Sources using Machine Learning extracting a name list from Wikipedia.  
* ISO/IEC 5218 proposes a norm about coding gender: ‚Äú0 as not know‚Äù, ‚Äú1 as male‚Äù, ‚Äú2 as female‚Äù and ‚Äú9 as not applicable‚Äù  
* The RFC 6350 (vCard) 5 where the section Gender has these categories: ‚Äúm as male‚Äù, ‚Äúf as female‚Äù, ‚Äúo as other‚Äù, ‚Äún as not applicable‚Äù and ‚Äúu as undefined‚Äù.  
* Okay reading. Grammar mistakes. Mentions lots of datasets, but no pointers.

[Damegender: Writing and Comparing Gender Detection Tools](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2754/paper3.pdf)
* Before damegender, only Gender guesser2 offered a free software solution in this field \[Kra06\], and the project (i) has not been active for more than three years now, (ii) lies technologically well behind other solutions. The best contribution of Gender guesser is the dataset containing 48,528 names with a good classification by countries  
* For instance, the Natural Language Tool Kit offers 8,000 labeled English names classified as male or female. Another example is Gender Guesser, which provides a good dataset for international names with different categories to define the probability. Although these datasets can be incorporated into damegender, the problem with them is that, in general, we have observed that they do not have the quality of National Statistics Institutes.  
* Santamarƒ±a and Mihaljevic \[SM18\] explain different ways to determine gender from a name; they offer 7,000 names that can serve as the golden set to evaluate them.  
* The best results are given by Support Vector Machines and Random Forest ‚Äì with those algorithms damegender achieves values that are close to more mature, proprietary solutions.

[Comparison and benchmark of name-to-gender inference services](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-156/)
* We compare and benchmark five name-to-gender inference services by applying them to the classification of a test data set consisting of 7,076 manually labeled names.  
* Another even simpler possibility to penalize non-classifications without giving them the same importance as to misclassifications is to minimize a metric such as errorCodedWithoutNA, which ignores the class ‚Äòunknown‚Äô, while enforcing a constraint on naCoded, i.e., the rate of non-classifications  
* For gender-guessers (not displayed) we have created one such parameter by setting it to 0.75 for responses ‚Äòmostly\_female‚Äô or ‚Äòmostly\_male‚Äô and 1 for ‚Äòfemale‚Äô or ‚Äòmale‚Äô.  
* In each of the 10 runs of 10-fold cross-validation, Gender API produces the lowest error, NamSor the second lowest. In this scenario, it is possible to achieve an average inaccuracy rate under 9% over the whole data set while keeping the misclassification error under 5% with Gender API. NamSor and genderize.io achieve second place with average inaccuracy rates just under 15%.  
* Python package gender-guesser achieves the lowest misclassification rate without parameter tuning for the entire data set, introducing also the smallest gender bias. At the same time it shows poor performance in terms of non-classifications, which is understandable given its comparatively small data base.

[The Financial Instability Hypothesis](https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf)
- The first theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that the economy has financing regimes under which it is stable, and financing regimes in which it is unstable. The second theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that over periods of prolonged prosperity, the economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable system to financial relations that make for an unstable system.  
- Furthermore, if an economy with a sizeable body of speculative financial units is in an inflationary state, and the authorities attempt to exorcise inflation by monetary constraint, then speculative units will become Ponzi units and the net worth of previously Ponzi units will quickly evaporate
