    While the HDHP is usually the cheapest option, the deductible is way too high to even consider it a viable health insurance.

    Contribution limit is calculated on monthly basis. Unlike IRAs, it’s risky to front load contributions because changing or losing the plan could mean going through a bureaucratic hells-cape and paying a hefty fine.

    Yearly contribution limit is really low. 10 years of contribution would barely pay for 10 days of hospital stays.

    The burden of proof is on your hands. You must keep all medical receipts in case of an audit. For the rest of your life.

    The tax benefit is not recognized by any other countries in the world.

    If you ever retire elsewhere with universal health care, it’ll most likely be useless.

    You have to file the 8889 form for your tax return.

    If you aren’t contributing directly from your paycheck, then it’s not 100% tax free contribution as FICA taxes aren’t deducted.

    It is seen as a holy trifecta of tax advantages investment vehicle where contribution, growth, and withdrawal are tax free for medical use. However, it’s not guaranteed to stay that way. HSA is pretty new (2004) and can be abused.

    The yield and/or capital gains will be taxed as an ordinary income for non-medical use after the retirement age.

    You can’t use it for paying health insurance premiums.

    If you have HDHP because you’re young and healthy, then HSA is quite useless. If you have a chronic illness, HSA would be useful but HDHP would be too costly.

    Entrusting your retirement health care in the stock market seems disturbing.
