[DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf)

> Some graphs are created as a by-product of agents interacting with a sequence of elements (e.g. usersâ€™ navigation of pages on a website). When a graph is created by such a stream of non-random walks, we can use this process to feed the modeling phase directly. Graphs sampled in this way will not only capture information related to network structure, but also to the frequency at which paths are traversed.
