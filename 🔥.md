[Do Stocks Outperform Treasury Bills?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447) 
> “Related, Lucca and Moench (2016) show that half of the excess return in US markets since 1980 accrues on the day before Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.”

[Buffett's Alpha](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3197185)
> The efficient-market counter argument is that Buffett may just have been lucky and, hence, many investors still wonder whether anyone has a chance to beat the market. Our findings suggest that Buffett’s success is neither luck nor magic, but reward for a successful implementation of value and quality exposures that have historically produced high returns.  

> Sharpe ratio of 1 or 2 is unrealistic. Most investors should seek to achieve between 0.5 and 0.79.

[The Financial Instability Hypothesis](https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf)

> The first theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that the economy has financing regimes under which it is stable, and financing regimes in which it is unstable. The second theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that over periods of prolonged prosperity, the economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable system to financial relations that make for an unstable system.  

> Furthermore, if an economy with a sizeable body of speculative financial units is in an inflationary state, and the authorities attempt to exorcise inflation by monetary constraint, then speculative units will become Ponzi units and the net worth of previously Ponzi units will quickly evaporate

[The (Geo)Politics of Controlling Shareholders](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-09-21-thegeopoliticsofcontrollingshareholders.pdf)
> “developmental state capitalism, Chinese party-state capitalism, Russian oligarchic-klepto capitalism, and high-tech surveillance capitalism – each of which has produced distinctive, globally active firms with controlling shareholders. The activity of these firms has generated many thorny policy dilemmas, both for their home governments and foreign policymakers.”

[Populists in Power: Economic and Political Consequences](https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/econpol-forum-2024-2-funke-schularick-trebesch-populism.pdf)
> After the populist takeover, tariff, debt, and inflation increased.  

> “The damage to democratic institutions may also explain why one populist is often followed by another and why populist governments often slip into authoritarianism and cling to power for a long time.”  

> “serial populism”

## Retirement Planning

[FIRE Flow Chart](https://u.cubeupload.com/demonlesondledon/FIREFlowChart.png)
> 401K match -> HSA -> 401K max -> Traditional IRA -> Roth IRA

### Brokerage

[Non-US investor's guide to navigating US tax traps](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Non-US_investor%27s_guide_to_navigating_US_tax_traps)
> Avoid either/both US/non-US domiciled ETFs. They are taxed heavily due to PFIC. QEF election is complex.

> There are no unlimited marital exemption for NRA spouse ($60,000).

### Traditional 401K/IRA

> Some countries treat traditional IRA distributions as capital gains as if it was a taxable brokerage account.

### Roth 401K/IRA

[Expat Roth Conversions Q&A](https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/expat-roth-conversions-qa/)
> Countries that regonized Roth are the followings: Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, United Kingdom, United States.

> Even if one is absolutely planning to retire in one of those countries, the complications from declaring and maintaining the Roth accounts will be non-negligible.

> Income from Roth could still count for the qualifying income or a portion of net-worth that affects health-care surcharge or a form of wealth tax, which would likely result in double taxation.

> Technically, US-France tax treaty does not mention Roth at all. In other words, it does not formally recognize the Roth.

> Most, like Belgium, do not tax the Roth IRA withdrawals but it still uses the income to calculate the tax rate one pays on other sources of income.

[The Great Roth Controversy](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/)
> Roth provides some flexibility around social security and Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). However, this requires about $10M in the tax deferred accounts.
> For the most common scenarios, a traditional retirement account is better than a brokerage account and both are better than a Roth IRA account.

### Health Savings Account

> HSA is touted as the "Tax Trifecta". However, it is not recognized by any other country in the world. The yearly contribution is relatively small and it requires lifetime commitment to archiving medical receipts.

### Social Security

[U.S. International Social Security Agreements](https://www.ssa.gov/international/agreements_overview.html)

[How Early Retirement Affects Social Security](https://rootofgood.com/early-retirement-social-security/)
> 10 years (40 credits) to qualify for free Medicare Part A coverage at age 65 (which would otherwise cost $400+ per month).

> In 2016 it takes $1,260 of income to earn one credit (up to four credits maximum per year).

> Even if you don’t have the 40 credits, it might not matter since you can qualify on a spouse’s (or ex-spouse’s) record if they have the required 40 credits.

> By back-calculating things a bit, the lifetime earnings to max out that 90% payout space is $359,520 (for 2016).  This could be $35,952 of earnings per year for ten years or roughly $72,000 for five years or around $18,000 for 20 years.

### Non-resident Alien

[Europeans with us retirement plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeFIRE/comments/mgajqq/europeans_with_us_retirement_plans/)
> If a non resident aliens withdraws from a 401k without a tax treaty, 30% withholding will be applied. Form 1040NR must be filed to claim the amount that was withheld due to the contributions being ECI.

> Even if one is covered by a tax treaty, a broker might not lower the withholding to 0%.

> US retirement accounts are always considered US Situs for the US Estate tax, which means that if you die holding more than 60k of assets in a US retirement account, you are looking at up to 40% tax on the account without an Estate tax treaty.

> Non-ECI is subject to 30% tax. (Non Effectively Connected Income: gains to a retirement account). EIC is subject to gradual tax bracket rates. (Effectively Connected Income: contributions to a retirement account).

> Non-resident does not have access to the standard deduction.

> The US had an estate tax treaty with Canada. Although the U.S.-Canada estate tax treaty ceased to have effect with respect to estates of persons dying on or after January 1, 1985, a protocol in the U.S.-Canadian bilateral income tax treaty has far reaching effects upon Canadian individuals owning U.S. situs assets for U.S. estate tax purposes.
