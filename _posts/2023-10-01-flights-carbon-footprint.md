title: "My flights in 2022 and the carbon footprint"
categories: Travel

In 2022, I've flown 25 times where 16 of those were domestic flights and the rest 9 were international flights.

I've flown across the pacific 4 times (2 round trips between US and Korea); and across the atlantic 3 times (1.5 round trips between US and europe).

### Carbon footprints

Calculating the carbon footprint of a flight is higly complex and varied.
For SEA-ICN one way, I could obtain the following results using various online calculators:
- 381.10kg (ICAO)
- 1056kg (ecotree) 
- 499kg (IATA)
- 2330kg (Sustainable Travel)
- 1400kg (myclimate)
- 2360kg (carbonfootprint.com)
- 1082kg (CarbonCompute.com)

I don't know much about the methods of flight carbon footprint, so I can't discern the most accurate result.
CarbonCompute.com is a project based on a research paper which can be found on https://www.carboncompute.com/how-it-works.

> The algorithm uses live data meaing we have a huge database over all current and historical flights flewn all over the world. 
> With this data we can match the exact aircraft your trip was, which fuel consumption was used by which engine, 
> how many people were aboard, seating classes, height factor, winglets and more.

Unfortunately, their online tool (https://www.carboncompute.com/find-flight-number) doesn't work so well. 
I'll be using [Flightera.net](https://www.flightera.net/) (uses CarbonCompute.com internally), which is how I came across it anyway.

Let's start with international flights:
- KE12: LAX-ICN: 1,700kg
- DL196: ICN-SEA: 1,082kg
- OG112: BOS-KEF: 400kg
- OG400: KEF-CDG: 333kg
- UA986: CDG-ORD: 798kg
- KE42: SEA-ICN: 1,751kg
- OZ204: ICN-LAX: 1,410kg
- SK946: ORD-ARN: 1,136kg
- SK577: ARN-CDG: 219kg

Total: 8829kg

According to EPA, this is equivalent to carbon emission of 2 cars, which is absolutely horrifying:

> A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. 

> This assumes the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon and drives around 11,500 miles per year.

https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle

For now, I'd estimate that the carbon footprint of my domestic flights would be equal.
This means that I've owned and drove an equivalent of 4 cars this year.
