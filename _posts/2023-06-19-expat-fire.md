[France](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/france-tax-treaty-documents)
- France shall consider a U.S. citizen or an alien admitted to the United States for permanent residence (a "green card" holder) to be a resident of the United States for the purposes of paragraph 1 only if such individual has a substantial presence in the United States or would be a resident of the United States and not of a third State under the principles of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 3.
- Subparagraph 2(a) provides rules for determining when a U.S. citizen or a "green card" holder is to be treated by France as a U.S. resident for purposes of enjoying the benefits of the Convention. If such an individual is a resident of both the United States and France under their respective domestic laws, the tie-breaker rules of paragraph 3 of the Article (discussed below) determine a single country of residence for all purposes of the Convention. If, however, the individual is not a resident of France, but is a U.S. citizen or green card holder resident in a third country, France will treat that individual as a resident of the United States only if he has a substantial presence in the United States or if his permanent home or habitual abode is in the United States and not in the third country. In applying the "substantial presence" test for this purpose, France will apply its own 183-day standard, because French tax is at issue.

> Green card holder is treaty same as a US citizen for tax treaty

- Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of France to a resident of France who is a citizen of the United States shall be taxable only in France.

#### Utilizing Treaties to Eliminate or Reduce the Foreign Investor’s Exposure to the U.S. Estate Tax \[[source](https://sftaxcounsel.com/a-deep-dive-into-u-s-estate-and-gift-tax-treaties/)]

- The United States has estate tax treaties with Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherland, Norway, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The United States has gift tax treaties (some of which are combined with the estate tax treaty) only with Australia, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
- The United States had an estate tax treaty with Canada. Although the U.S.-Canada estate tax treaty ceased to have effect with respect to estates of persons dying on or after January 1, 1985, a protocol in the U.S.-Canadian bilateral income tax treaty has far reaching effects upon Canadian individuals owning U.S. situs assets for U.S. estate tax purposes.

#### Unverified facts

- If a non resident aliens withdraws from a 401k without a tax treaty, 30% withholding will be applied.

- Even one is covered by a tax treaty, a broker might not lower the withholding to 0%.
- US taxation for non resident aliens is 100x worse than for US residents.

- Forms 1040NR takes a long time (+6 months)
- Non-resident does not have access to the standard deduction.
- non-ECI is subject to 30% tax.
- EIC is subject to gradual tax bracket rates.

- Non Effectively Connected Income: gains to a retirement account
- Some foreign countries treat traditional IRA distributions as capital gains as if it was a taxable brokerage.
- France does not recognize Roth as tax free rather France doesn't tax US based retirement accounts.
- Most, like Belgium, don't tax the withdrawals but still use it to calculate the tax rate you pay on other sources of income (just like the FEIE works for US taxes).

- 10 years (40 credits) to qualify for free Medicare Part A coverage at age 65 (which would otherwise cost $400+ per month).
- In 2016 it takes $1,260 of income to earn one credit (up to four credits maximum per year).
- Even if you don’t have the 40 credits, it might not matter since you can qualify on a spouse’s (or ex-spouse’s) record if they have the required 40 credits.
- By back-calculating things a bit, the lifetime earnings to max out that 90% payout space is $359,520 (for 2016).  This could be $35,952 of earnings per year for ten years or roughly $72,000 for five years or around $18,000 for 20 years.
