[Expat Roth Conversions Q&A](https://creativeplanning.com/international/insights/expat-roth-conversions-qa/)

> Countries that regonized Roth are the followings: Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, United Kingdom, United States.

> Even if one is absolutely planning to retire in one of those countries, the complications from declaring and maintaining the Roth accounts will be non-negligible.

> Income from Roth could still count for the qualifying income or a portion of net-worth that affects health-care surcharge or a form of wealth tax, which would likely result in double taxation.

> Technically, US-France tax treaty does not mention Roth at all. In other words, it does not formally recognize the Roth.

> Most, like Belgium, do not tax the Roth IRA withdrawals but it still uses the income to calculate the tax rate one pays on other sources of income.

> Roth provides some flexibility around social security and Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). However, this requires about $10M in the tax deferred accounts.
> For the most common scenarios, a traditional retirement account is better than a brokerage account and both are better than a Roth IRA account.

> Even if you don’t have the 40 credits, it might not matter since you can qualify on a spouse’s (or ex-spouse’s) record if they have the required 40 credits.

> By back-calculating things a bit, the lifetime earnings to max out that 90% payout space is $359,520 (for 2016).  This could be $35,952 of earnings per year for ten years or roughly $72,000 for five years or around $18,000 for 20 years.
