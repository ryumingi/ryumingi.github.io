  </summary>

  <p>
  The first theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that the economy has financing regimes
  under which it is stable, and financing regimes in which it is
  unstable. The second theorem of the financial instability
  hypothesis is that over periods of prolonged prosperity, the
  economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable
  system to financial relations that make for an unstable system.
  </p>

  <p>
  Furthermore, if an economy with a sizeable body of speculative
  financial units is in an inflationary state, and the authorities
  attempt to exorcise inflation by monetary constraint, then
  speculative units will become Ponzi units and the net worth of
  previously Ponzi units will quickly evaporate
