</summary>

<p>
The first theorem of the financial instability hypothesis is that the economy has financing regimes
under which it is stable, and financing regimes in which it is
unstable. The second theorem of the financial instability
hypothesis is that over periods of prolonged prosperity, the
economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable
system to financial relations that make for an unstable system.

<p>
Furthermore, if an economy with a sizeable body of speculative
financial units is in an inflationary state, and the authorities
attempt to exorcise inflation by monetary constraint, then
speculative units will become Ponzi units and the net worth of
previously Ponzi units will quickly evaporate
