[DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf)

> Some graphs are created as a by-product of agents interacting with a sequence of elements (e.g. usersâ€™ navigation of pages on a website). When a graph is created by such a stream of non-random walks, we can use this process to feed the modeling phase directly. Graphs sampled in this way will not only capture information related to network structure, but also to the frequency at which paths are traversed.

[The freedom trap: digital nomads and the use of disciplining practices to manage work/leisure boundaries](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40558-020-00172-4)

> It is found that in practice, digital nomadism is not always experienced as autonomous and free but is a way of living that requires high levels of discipline and self-discipline.
